Why we use Facebook
Using Facebook as our login system helps improve the user experience in a number of ways:
1. It makes it super fast to sign up and create EcoTravel profile.
2. It allows you to see how much C02 your friends produced and saved.
3. It helps ensure that people are using their real identities.
4. It makes it easy for you to share stuff with your Facebook friends, if you want to.

We really want to earn your trust. Sharing is always under your control and we will not misuse your personal information in any way.
